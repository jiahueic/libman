## Library Management System
1. Created a library catalogue where the library staffs can add, edit or delete books. <br />
2. Also, library staffs can view the books loaned by each student. <br />
3. A book can only be loaned if it has a quantity of more than zero in the library catalogue. <br />
4. Each student can borrow many books at one time. <br />
5. Each book can be borrowed by many students. <br />
6. There are three tables or 'apps', for this project, namely, Student, BookLoan and Book. <br />
7. The database tables are created using the inheritance of the models class from Django. <br />
8. The CRUD operations for each tables are created using class-based views. <br />
9. There are three files needed for the deployment of Django on Heroku, runtime.txt, requirements,txt and Procfile
10. requirements.txt states the pip dependencies of the project
11. These three files should have the same file heritance level as manage.py

Technologies used: Django, SQLite, HTML, CSS <br />
